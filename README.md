MAGNUM_PI

this is a personal django project to accomplish three things:

  1. catalog all the images in my archive on a server at home
  2. become familiar with the latest django code
  3. satisfy the desire to code from time to time

i need an interface to view thumbnails of images on the server 
rather than trying access them on a network connect across my
home network. i hope to also have it serve as a portal to view
the images remotely from a web interface.

let's begin...
